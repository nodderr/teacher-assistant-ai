\section*{Solution to Question 30 (A)}

\textbf{Question:}
Two water taps together can fill a tank in $9\frac{3}{8}$ hours. The tap of larger diameter takes 10 hours less than the smaller one to fill the tank separately. Find the time in which each tap can separately fill the tank.

\textbf{Step-by-step Solution:}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Define the variables:}
    Let the time taken by the smaller tap to fill the tank be $x$ hours.
    Then, the time taken by the larger tap to fill the tank is $(x - 10)$ hours.

    \item \textbf{Determine the rate of filling for each tap:}
    The part of the tank filled by the smaller tap in 1 hour = $\frac{1}{x}$.
    The part of the tank filled by the larger tap in 1 hour = $\frac{1}{x - 10}$.

    \item \textbf{Determine the combined rate:}
    The total time taken by both taps together to fill the tank is $9\frac{3}{8}$ hours.
    Converting this mixed fraction to an improper fraction:
    \[ 9\frac{3}{8} = \frac{9 \times 8 + 3}{8} = \frac{75}{8} \text{ hours} \]
    The part of the tank filled by both taps together in 1 hour = $\frac{1}{75/8} = \frac{8}{75}$.

    \item \textbf{Set up the equation:}
    According to the problem, the sum of the individual rates equals the combined rate:
    \[ \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x - 10} = \frac{8}{75} \]

    \item \textbf{Solve the equation:}
    Find a common denominator for the left side:
    \[ \frac{(x - 10) + x}{x(x - 10)} = \frac{8}{75} \]
    \[ \frac{2x - 10}{x^2 - 10x} = \frac{8}{75} \]
    Cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:
    \[ 75(2x - 10) = 8(x^2 - 10x) \]
    \[ 150x - 750 = 8x^2 - 80x \]
    Rearrange the terms into a standard quadratic equation form ($ax^2 + bx + c = 0$):
    \[ 8x^2 - 80x - 150x + 750 = 0 \]
    \[ 8x^2 - 230x + 750 = 0 \]
    Divide the entire equation by 2 to simplify:
    \[ 4x^2 - 115x + 375 = 0 \]

    \item \textbf{Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:}
    The quadratic formula is $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 4$, $b = -115$, and $c = 375$.
    First, calculate the discriminant ($D$):
    \[ D = b^2 - 4ac = (-115)^2 - 4(4)(375) \]
    \[ D = 13225 - 6000 = 7225 \]
    Now, find the square root of the discriminant:
    \[ \sqrt{D} = \sqrt{7225} = 85 \]
    Substitute these values into the quadratic formula:
    \[ x = \frac{115 \pm 85}{2 \times 4} \]
    This gives two possible values for $x$:
    \[ x_1 = \frac{115 + 85}{8} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]
    \[ x_2 = \frac{115 - 85}{8} = \frac{30}{8} = 3.75 \]

    \item \textbf{Evaluate the solutions:}
    If $x = 3.75$, then the time taken by the larger tap would be $x - 10 = 3.75 - 10 = -6.25$ hours. Since time cannot be negative, $x = 3.75$ is not a valid solution.
    Therefore, $x = 25$ is the correct value.

    \item \textbf{Final Answer:}
    Time taken by the smaller tap to fill the tank separately = \textbf{25 hours}.
    Time taken by the larger tap to fill the tank separately = $25 - 10 = $ \textbf{15 hours}.
